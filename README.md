# FriendFinder
Thi application is a compatibility based "friend finder" app, basically a dating app. This is a full-stack site that will take in the results from your survey and then compare your answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

I am the sole contributor to the front and back ends of this application.
